I have ordered cookies to be delivered to our first ECL class. We will try to get to know each other and I will attempt to describe my research work and educational background for you, as well as what we should expect from this course. Then I will give you links to two surveys that will assess your programming knowledge and will determine the favorite programming language which the majority of class wish to learn.

## About me, Amir, the instructor

I am a physicist and researcher, currently at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ices.utexas.edu/">Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences</a> at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.utexas.edu/">The University of Texas at Austin</a>. I am a member of the <a target="_blank" href="http://cco.ices.utexas.edu/">Center for Computational Oncology</a> led by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bme.utexas.edu/about-us/faculty-directory/yankeelov">Dr. Thomas E. Yankeelov</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ices.utexas.edu/people/85/">Dr. J. Tinsley Oden</a> at ICES with the goal of understanding Tumor Growth.

The following figures show the growth of Glioblastoma tumor cells in a Rat's brain over time.

One of the fields on which my research is currently focused, is developing Monte Carlo optimizer/sampler and integrator algorithms for Bayesian inverse problems. Below you see example animations of two [Markov Chain Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo){:target="_blank"} (MCMC) samplers, both of which sample a double Gaussian-peak function, but with different MCMC sampling parameters.

While my current focus of research is mathematical modelling of tumor growth and Monte Carlo samplers, I am and have been working in multiple branches of science and engineering for several years, from the subatomic world of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle">elementary particles</a>, to the microscopic world of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromolecule">biological macromolecules</a>, to <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-ray_burst">astrophysical phenomena</a> occurring on the grandest scales of the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe">observable Universe</a>.

For several years of my research, I have been working on understanding Gamma-Ray Bursts and their physics. Below is a movie of the moment a GRB is generated.
