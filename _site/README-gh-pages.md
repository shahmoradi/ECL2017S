This branch contains the files needed for the website of the Spring 2017 course Engineering Computation Lab.
The design of the website is based on Jekyll and a variant of the "notepad" template by Hossain Mohammad Faysal @ UPENN.
  
Main Features of notepad:

* Zurb Foundation 5 â€“ css framework
* Scss files with settings file
