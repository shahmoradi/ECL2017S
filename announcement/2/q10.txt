Just a bit slow. I would like to just stop babying people, it's homework, things should be done by the time we get here or else we're just debugging problems here.

Please end the class on time! I have class at 10 AM sharp and must leave no later than 9:50.

At this point, assignments with Python are needed to start improving upon programming and computation based skills, since I feel like not much has been accomplished in the class. The most useful yet easiest change would be to publish the lectures ahead of time, so I have a better idea of what the next class will be over.

I would really love class time to be spent exclusively on python and the jupyter environment. I really dislike the use of Git for this class, and I feel it detracts from our learning of the real material. I wish we could just submit our stuff to you via canvas or some other means. I feel like we haven't adequately covered github, and yet just about all classtime thus far has been dedicated to it. I was hoping for this class to teach me python but I honestly feel bogged down by github and the means of submission- I feel we are spending time on the wrong thing. I think github has a time and place, but I don't feel that it is appropriate for this class. Overall though, I think you are doing an excellent job teaching and I look forward to learning more with you.

I am impressed with how much I have been able to get out of a 1 hour course so far.

Not your fault, but simply 1 hour a week of lecture time is not enough.

Homework instructions are very clear but I'm confused on the way to present the outputs.

I only wish this course was more like a real computing course instead of a 1hr lab. It would be a lot more useful if we could meet 2x a week and had more 1-on-1 time.

Love the course so far. Learning so much. The grades worry me though - there needs to be a clearer understanding of what's going to be on a quiz and the homeworks need to be a little more well defined. The first two quizzes and first homework were rough but quiz 3 and homework 2 already got so much better. Thanks so much!

Ask more concept based questions rather than memory. Other than that, I really like this class.

All the information we are supposed to get out of this course is so critical. Version Control, python programming, learning linux.. it's all perfect. We just need more time. If this were a 2 or 3 hours course that would be incredible. If we met MWF 9-10, this class would be my favorite, and I would be so confident in my computer science ability.

This class definitely needs more time per week than 1 hour. This is not enough time at all to give out all the information needed.
